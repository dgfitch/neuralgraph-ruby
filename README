UI is as follows right now, until the radial menu fanciness is in:

Click to select.
Click-drag to rubber-band select.
Shift-click nodes to add/remove from selection.

Click-drag nodes to move.
Shift-click-drag nodes to connect.

Shift-click empty space to create.
Shift-right-click empty space to create a sampler node. Which does nothing, yet.

D to delete nodes. (I can't get DELETE or BACKSPACE to work.)

There is no sound yet.
